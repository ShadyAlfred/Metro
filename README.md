# Metro
*A simple python console app to count the stations and show the shortest path between any two stations of the Metro in Cairo*


* It needs two stations, a starting station `Source`, and an ending station `Destination`.


P.S. it is case sensitive, thus it is more convenient to copy and paste the desired station's name.

* In case of quality between two or more paths, the app will print the all paths.

* Uses the [NetworkX Module](https://networkx.github.io/) to construct the Cairene Metro network.

* The [Colorama Module](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) is used to show colorful console text.
